                    Anand is a joyful, play-based well-being program designed to nurture a child’s natural curiosity and spontaneity. We believe that {" "}<span className="font-semibold">play is a right rather than a reward</span>{" "}
                    —it is the essential language through which children explore the world. By centering &quot;play&quot; as a primary creative medium, Anand helps children build foundational resilience and social-emotional skills in a low-pressure, high-engagement environment.
