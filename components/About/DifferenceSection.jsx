          Artbeat is distinguished by being neither a clinical therapy nor a
          traditional art class but a child-centric well-being program that
          integrates music, visual arts, writing, and storytelling with
          contemporary research and endorsed practices in child development,
          social-emotional learning (SEL), and trauma-informed care in India.
          Artbeat draws on current evidence and recognized educational
          frameworks as well as learnings from leading initiatives in the
          country to shape its holistic approach to children's well-being.
